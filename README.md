# Save Logcat Android
Simple way to save local logcat via Java wiithout root. It does not save full logcat from device, just only from the app.

Save logcat if a bug occured and sent it to the modder. Clear logcat and reproduce bug again if the log file is too large

Saving logcat does not need file permission. Logcat location:

Android 11: /storage/emulated/0/Documents/

Android 10 and below: /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/(package name)/files/Mod Menu
